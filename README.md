# paginate-through-mysql-data-on-a-table
Pagination system designed for a table with data extracted from MySQL database using PHP.

In this project, a directory is created with a table of 10 rows than can be paginated through. This data is extracted
from a MySQL database. Recently, I implemented this code to paginate through a directory of GoFundMe campaigns in my 
website Humanos Venezuela, which is dedicated to help the Venezuelan families during the humanitarian crisis. Feel free to check
it out at www.humanosvenezuela.com
